This project contains [@jonathan-hellwig](https://github.com/jonathan-hellwig/) and my first attempt toward a ray tracing algorithm. It was produced from scratch in a couple of hours but works fairly well. 
We used literature mainly by Cervery[^1] for basic orientation.
This work was motivated purely by interest and fun for coding.
